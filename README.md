# **KonzeptPlus Chat Room**
### Why did **I** build this?
My main focus was to show what I'm capable of. So I built a Chat Room app, in that way i can show my programming skills and my Best Pratices/code conventions.

### What is KonzeptPlus Chat Room? 
This is private chat rooms for Konzept Plus Meeting. This chat room is mainly for work purpose and not for anything else.
### What did i use for languages?
For this project i mainly used **JavaScript, HTML and CSS**.

### Animations 
For the background animation, I used **Particle JS** which is CDN framework and a open source. It is a **responsive** and **interactive** background.
For the text animation, I used CSS animation.

### Usage
Before you Start the website you have to install Node Modules with yarn or npm with the following commands:
You can access the web application by going to a web broswer and either with **192.168.x.x:3000(ip-adress:port) or localhost:3000**

### NPM
```bash
npm install 
```
```bash
npm run dev 
```
### Yarn 
```bash
yarn install 
```
```bash
yarn dev 
```
### Docker Problem
I try to **containerize** with **Docker** but i'm getting a error all the time.
I will be trying to slove the problem in the near future.

### Next Step 
I will be implementing a database and a Authentication with the help of Firebase.
